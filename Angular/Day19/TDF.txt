Angular has class FormControl
- Used for status & Validity
-we have to use multiple properties
 1 valid -is valid
 2 invalid - is  invalid true
 3 dirty- You typed in that element it is called dirty => true
 4 pristine - we not touched that field or HTML element,also it is called clean means you do not type any thing in that.
 5 errors  - is error or not
 6 touched - If you touched that dom element it's flag is true



- The ngModel directive creates the FormControl Instance (angular creates FormControl object) to manage the template form control
- when we use ngModel directives we must use 'name' attribute given by HTML, it is required for ngModel
 - ngModel directive holds the control, that you created for the element and name attribute, also it monitors their properties, including their validity
- Also Use "required" attribute given by html on that basis we check the error is there or not
